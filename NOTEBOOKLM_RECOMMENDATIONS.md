## 🔄 Alternative Approach: Individual Audios

### Variant A: 12 Short Audios

Create **separate audio for each manual** (Shorter - 5 min).

**Pros:**

- Can choose which to deep dive later

**Cons:**
- 12 audios is a lot
- May have repetition
- Harder to get big picture

### Variant B: 2 Large Audios

**Audio 1:** All small manuals (under 1MB) together
**Audio 2:** All large manuals (over 1MB) together

**Pros:**
- Simpler
- Two comprehensive overviews

**Cons:**
- May be too general
- Harder to navigate by topic

## 💡 Tips for People with ADHD

- Take breaks as needed

### Note Taking
- Play NotebookLM in background
- Take notes on key points
